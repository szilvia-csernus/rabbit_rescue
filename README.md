[![DeepScan grade](https://deepscan.io/api/teams/23376/projects/26637/branches/850426/badge/grade.svg)](https://deepscan.io/dashboard#view=project&tid=23376&pid=26637&bid=850426)



> **Hopper Farm Rabbit Rescue** is a fictional non-profit organisation.
The website is designed to support the charity's primary mission which is to help find new homes for rescued pet rabbits. Admins can add/edit/delete rabbit records. Users can get information about the work of the charity, the adoption process as well as individual rabbits which are listed for adoption.


**This App is a `Full Stack` `Progressive Web App (PWA)`, `installable` and `fully responsive` on all devices.**


The Frontend is implemented with `React JS, Redux, React-Router, CSS Modules, HTML5` and `Figma` for design.
Payment is implemented with `STRIPE Link`.
The Backend is built with `Django REST` and the database with `PostgreSQL`.
The `EmailJS` API is used to send forms. Dark mode is implemented throughout all pages.

> I originally created the frontend of this project for Code Institute's Web Application Development Course as the 1st Milestone Project (User Centric Frontend Development Project) in `HTML5-CSS3-BOOTSTRAP5`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/szilvia-csernus/rabbit-sanctuary).

# Features

The frontend of this project is a `Single Page Application (SPA)`. React-Router was used to render three pages: `About` page, `Adopt` page and a `Contact Us` page. In addition, I added  modals for displaying the `volunteering form` and the `rabbit enquiry form` as well as the `thank you` and `error` messages.

I also implemented `Progressive Web App (PWA)` features such as caching and installability.



## Installation


Installation on Desktop is available through the "install" icon in the brwoser's search bar.


![Install App on Desktop](readme-images/install-app-desktop.jpeg)

## Dark-mode responsive SVG icons


All **icons** are in `SVG` format that allowed me to set their colours programatically to respond to dark mode.


|Rabbit|Gift|People|Hands|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|![icon-rabbit](readme-images/icon-rabbit-light.jpeg)|![icon-gift](readme-images/icon-gift-light.jpeg)|![icon-people](readme-images/icon-people-light.jpeg)|![icon-hands](readme-images/icon-hands-light.jpeg)|
|![icon-rabbit](readme-images/icon-rabbit-dark.jpeg)|![icon-gift](readme-images/icon-gift-dark.jpeg)|![icon-people](readme-images/icon-people-dark.jpeg)|![icon-hands](readme-images/icon-hands-dark.jpeg)|


Similarly, the Favicons respond to dark mode too:


![favicon-light-mode](readme-images/favicon-light-mode.svg)
![favicon-dark-mode](readme-images/favicon-dark-mode.svg)



## Adopt Page


The `Adopt page` provides essential information about rabbit re-homing and also includes a gallery, listing all rabbits from the database that are eligible for adoption. 



![adopt-light-mode](readme-images/adopt-light-mode.jpeg)
![adopt-dark-mode](readme-images/adopt-dark-mode.jpeg)

The user can click on the rabbit pictures to get more information:

![more-info](readme-images/more-info.jpeg)

When clicking `Enquire`, an Enquiry Form appears:

![enquiry-form](readme-images/enquiry-form.jpeg)

The 'Name' and the 'Email' fields are required fields:

![form-validation](readme-images/form-validation.jpeg)


A 'Thank You Message' notifies the user of a successful form submission:
![thanks-interest](readme-images/thanks-interest.jpeg)



## Contact Us Page



On the `Contact Us page`, I included all the contact information the organisation can be reached from. Alongside the address, a live Google Maps frame helps with orientation.

![contact-light-mode](readme-images/contact-light-mode.jpeg)
![contact-dark-mode](readme-images/contact-dark-mode.jpeg)

The submission of a `Volunteer form` is another way of contacting the charity:

|Volunteer Form - Light|Volunteer Form - Dark|
|:-:|:-:|
|![volunteer-form-light-mode](readme-images/volunteer-form-light-mode.jpeg)|![volunteer-form-dark-mode](readme-images/volunteer-form-dark-mode.jpeg)|




## Donation Payments

I used the `Stripe Link` API for secure donation payments:

![stripe-donation](readme-images/stripe-donation.jpeg)

|Success Message - Light|Success Message - Dark|
|:--:|:--:|
|![successful-payment-light](readme-images/successful-payment-light.jpeg)|![successful-payment-dark](readme-images/successful-payment-dark.jpeg)|

# Data



## Schema


The relational database is built with `PostgreSQL` and Django's object-model system. I'm utilizing Django's built-in `auth` app and the `admin` panel, where users with `staff` permissions can add/edit/delete rabbit records.

The data model for rabbits comprises of 3 tables. As adoption of rabbits often happens in groups, I planned to list these rabbits together on the website. For this, I needed a `rabbit_group` model, which can include one or more individual rabbits. Similarly, the `image` model belongs to the rabbit_group, not to the individual rabbit, as the rabbits are often pictured together, not individually.

![data-model](readme-images/data-model.jpeg)



## Fixtures


I wrote a python script, `generate_fixtures.py`, to generate random data for my database. With this, I generated three json fixtures which I then used to load the records into the database:

- `rabbit_groups.json`
- `rabbits.json`
- `rabbit_images.json`

---

# Admin Functions


Admin functions are available through Django's built-in `admin-panel`. As this is part of my backend application, I configured the frontend-serving Nginx server to proxy-route the user here from the Frontend site. The link for this can be found in the `Footer` section of the site:


![admin-login](readme-images/admin-login-link.jpeg)
![admin-login-andrew](readme-images/admin-login-andrew.jpeg)
![admin-rabbit-groups](readme-images/admin-rabbit-groups.jpeg)
![admin-edit-rabbits](readme-images/admin-edit-rabbits.jpeg)

---


# Progressive Web App

I implemented PWA to allow the user to install the app, as well as to cache the static files to decrease subsequent loading times.

![PWA](readme-images/pwa.jpeg)

---


# Local Development


To run and develop this project locally, the following steps are needed.



## Backend


0. Prerequisite: Make sure that `python` is installed.
1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a virtual environment in the root folder: `python3 -m venv venv`
3. Activate this environment with either a prompt from the IDE or with `source venv/bin/activate`
4. `cd backend` and install the python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Start the dev server: `python manage.py runserver`

The backend project will be available on the default django port: http://localhost:8000



## Frontend


0. Prerequisite: Make sure that `node` is installed.
1. From the root folder, `cd frontend` and install all packages with `npm install`.
2. Start the development server with `npm start`

The frontend project will be running on the default Vite port: http://localhost:5173


---


# Testing

Please view [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for more information on testing.


---


# Deployment


Both the backend and the Frontend are deployed on Heroku, in eco dynos. (As this is the most economical tier, the initial loading time is fairly long when the user visits the site for the first time.)



## Backend


The django project is running on a `Gunicorn` server. The django projects' `CORS` and `CSRF` settings make sure that the Frontend can initiate communication.
In the `Procfile`, I specified the commands that are needed after the build process: run all migrations and start up the Gunicorn server.


Environment variables:
+ SECRET_KEY
+ DATABASE_URL
+ CLOUDINARY_URL
+ FRONTEND_URL (required for the CORS and CSRF settings in settings.py)
+ BACKEND_HOST (required for the ALLOWED_HOSTS setting in settings.py)



## Frontend


To build the frontend project for production, we can utilize the built-in `npm run build` script, that builds the React app for production. We can run this locally and the run the project with `npm run preview` to test the production version locally.

In Heroku, I used the `nodejs` buildpack to run this process automatically with the help of the "heroku-postbuild" script which I included into the `package.json` file.

As a second step, I used an `nginx` buildpack to serve my frontend with the Nginx server. I included a config file for this (frontend/config/nginx.conf.erb). I configured this server to proxy-route my api requests (rabbit data requests) to the backend server. I also proxy-routed the requests for 'admin' (and the 'static' files that belong to the admin panel) so that the charity owner can reach the admin site from the Frontend.

As Environment variables, I used
+ BACKEND_URL (used for proxy-routing)
+ STRIPE_URL (for payments)


---


# CI/CD with Github Actions


I automated the deployment process by utilizing Github Actions Workflows. On every `push` action, my `main.yml` file first runs all the automated tests and only if they pass deploys the application, backend and frontend into their own respective Heroku dynos.

The result of the latest deployment is represented with this badge:

# Design


All wireframes and design were created in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).



## Colour Scheme

Animal charities most frequently use green as their primary colour and I kept the site in line with this customer expectation. I chose orange as an accent colour to emphasize the 'call to action' messages. In addition, I used various shades of greys to complement the two main colours.

I sampled the primary and the accent colours from the hero image of the landing page, then I slightly modified them to satisfy accessibility requirements. 

![Light mode palette:](readme-images/colour-palette-light.svg)

![Dark mode palette:](readme-images/colour-palette-dark.svg)



## Typography


A font pairing website [Typ.io](https://typ.io/lists) helped me make typograpy choice.
I selected [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) and [Nunito Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito+Sans) from the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) library for their simplicity and legibility yet fairly informal feel. To complement these simple styled main fonts, for the feature logo I chose a more decorative typeface, [Bubblegum Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bubblegum+Sans).



## Imagery


All the **images** appearing on the site are unlicenced, sourced from [Pexels](https://pexels.com/) and [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). All pictures have been converted to `.webp` format to reduce file size and as such, reduce loading time. To further increase performance, more image sizes are available for the browser to load the most appropriate one for any screen resolutions. For older browsers that don't recognise `.webp` format, `.png` images were added as backups. This method makes sure that for every device, the best size and resolution will be chosen to achieve the best possible performance.

Some of the icons I drew myself in Figma, the others I downloaded from [svgrepo](https://svgrepo.com/). These latter icons are either unlicenced or open-source. All icons were drawn or edited to be uniform in design as well as responsive to dark mode or - as in the case of the rabbit icon - to screen size changes. All icons' colour is set programatically width css.

All references to the images and icons that have been sourced from other sites can be found in the [credits](#credits) section.

## Future Implementations



* Replacing the `EmailJS` API with a setup of an SMTP service provider such as Google MAIL.
* Building a comprehensive Admin interface in the Frontend.
* Infinite scroll implementation for listing rabbits, for the scenario that numbers increase significantly.

---



## Accessibility



* To aid screen readers: 
  * `Semantic HTML` were used throughout all pages.

  * All images have descriptive `alt` attributes and all other elements that have implied meanings are labelled with `aria-labels`.

  * Current pages and modals are also labelled with the appropriate `aria properties` to help navigation.

* `Lighthouse` score for `Accessibility` are **100%** across all pages. Detailed results can be found [here](TESTING.md#lighthouse-tests).

* Contrasts were checked with [a11y Contrast Checker](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/). All pages passed the test, detailed results can be found [here](TESTING.md#accessibility-tests).
